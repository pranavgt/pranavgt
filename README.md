### Iâ€™m Building Toward
##         
Hi I'm **Pranav** a [final-year undergraduate at Wharton](https://linkedin.com/in/pranavguhathakurta)  (Major: Finance, Minor: CS). My interests lie at the intersection of **efficient computation**, **scalable AI**, and **product design for the real world**.

+ Focused on building **purpose-built AI systems** that are fast, lean, and private by default  
+ Interested in ***right*** scaling architectures and efficient search. (Cost pressures are already here!)

### Iâ€™m Building Toward

Modern LLMs are overkill for most tasks. Iâ€™m focused on designing systems that:

-- **Purpose-built AI systems** that are **fast, lean,** and **private by default** â€” solving real-world problems without unnecessary complexity. Use **right-sized models** for specific, high-leverage problems  
-- **Privacy-first compute** that doesnâ€™t require cloud-scale firepower  
-- Leverage **coarse-grained search structures** (like HNSW) for smart retrieval  
-- Avoid complexity when simplicity wins â€” _don't bring an axe when a penknife will do_

---

### Technical Interests

-- Lightweight LLMs & private inference  
-- Hierarchical search (ANN, HNSW, vector graphs)  
-- RAG pipelines with smart retrieval logic  
-- Scalable backends for AI infra  
-- Systems that blend data, compute, and intent

---

### Currently Exploring

-- Fine-tuning vs. distillation tradeoffs  
-- Composability in AI agents  
-- Zero-trust architectures for edge inference  
-- Real-world applications of token-efficient transformers

###  Letâ€™s Connect

Im always up for building something weird, fast, and useful. Hit me up if you want to talk about collaborting on: 

AI infra â€¢ Private compute â€¢ Search architecture â€¢ Applied ML
