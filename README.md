## Hey, I'm Pranav                                              [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/pranavguhathakurta)  

I'm a final-year undergraduate Wharton (Finance with a minor in Computer Science). My interests lie at the intersection of **efficient computation**, **scalable AI**, and **product design for the real world**.

+ Obsessed with building **purpose-built AI systems** that are fast, lean, and private by default  
+ Interested in *right* scaling architectures and efficient search. (Cost pressures are already here!)

### I’m Building Toward

Modern LLMs are overkill for most tasks. I’m focused on designing systems that:

-- **Purpose-built AI systems** that are **fast, lean,** and **private by default** — solving real-world problems without unnecessary complexity. Use **right-sized models** for specific, high-leverage problems  
-- **Privacy-first compute** that doesn’t require cloud-scale firepower  
-- Leverage **coarse-grained search structures** (like HNSW) for smart retrieval  
-- Avoid complexity when simplicity wins — _don't bring an axe when a penknife will do_
