## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Pranav

I'm a final-year undergraduate studying Finance at Wharton with a minor in Computer Science. My interests live at the intersection of **efficient computation**, **scalable AI**, and **product design for the real world**.

### ðŸ§  What Iâ€™m Building Toward

Modern AI tools are powerful â€” but bloated. We're using jet engines to light birthday candles. I'm driven to explore and build systems that are:

- **Right-sized** for their use cases  
- **Private by design**  
- **Scalable** without depending on hyperscale infrastructure  
- **Purpose-built**, not general-purpose guesses

My current focus is on:
- Compact architectures for **local inference**  
- **Search structure optimization** in coarse search stages of proximity graph methods (e.g., HNSW)  
- The emerging need for **modular, adaptive, private LLMs** that donâ€™t pretend to solve everything

### ðŸ”§ Technical Areas Iâ€™m Into

- Lightweight & domain-specific LLMs  
- Efficient vector search (ANN, HNSW, Graph-based IR)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems  
- Scalable backend systems & API design  
- Data pipelines with a security and compliance edge

### ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

- Practical limits of fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering  
- Private compute architectures for decentralized inference  
- How to make the right thing _small_, _fast_, and _useful_

### ðŸ”— Letâ€™s Connect

Feel free to check out my repos or reach out. Iâ€™m always happy to exchange ideas on building lean AI infrastructure, tradeoffs in system design, or emerging compliance frontiers in LLMs.
